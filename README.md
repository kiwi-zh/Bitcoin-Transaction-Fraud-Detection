# Bitcoin-Transaction-Fraud-Detection


Ransomware attacks are one of the most dangerous related crimes in the coin market. To increase the challenge of fighting the attack, early detection of ransomware seems necessary. In this article, we propose a high-performance Bitcoin transaction predictive system that investigates Bitcoin payment transactions to learn data patterns that can recognize and classify ransomware payments for heterogeneous bitcoin networks into malicious or benign transactions. We used Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) on the BitcoinHeist ransomware dataset in terms of classification accuracy and other evaluation measures such as F1-score.

We recommend jupyter notebook==6.5.2 and python==3.10.9 to run this notebook.
